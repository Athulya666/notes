IDS sniff network packet. decoder is used to decode the information in the packet to understand the network packet and matches the pattern in the packet with the signature in the database.

Snort rule
-rule header
	alert TCP sourceip port -> destination ip any(any port)
-rule options
	content : "microsoft" ; flow : established; sid : 5500

attacker evasion technique
	string matching weaknesses - use encoding/ capital simple letters
	fragmentation attacks
	-overlapping
	-time out - 
	-bad checksum - checksum used in ip header to identify any corruption in the packet.
	DoS
	send data with SYN packet
prevention from these
	IDS should reconstruct the packet in a same way as destination device doing
IDS/IPS analyse after the three way handshake.
