xaas - anything as service
		-metal as service(MaaS)
		-Security as a service (SECaaS)(malware scanning, network monitoring...)
saas - software as a service ex- office 365/ gmail - limited security
paas - platform as a service ex- sql or nonsql databases/hosted functions/API/code repositories
iaas - infrastructure as a service ex- cloud storage/cloud networking/cloud hosted hypervisors and virtual machines

cloud protection ways
waf - web applicaton server ex- block ddos ip in web application
identity access management
for cloud users check - continuous policy checks/certifications/audit
encryption/ monitoring

NIST cloud computing
-measured service
-broad network access
-resource pooling
-rapid elasticity
-on demand self service

cloud reconnaissance-  
obtaining information/DNS records/packet captures/port scans/vulnerability scans

cloud Enumeration-
networks/virtual machines/databases/users,groups,security principals

gain access-
online or offline/compromise cloud accounts/social engineering/malware

maintain access-
hide access/create a backdoor to evade detection/ create new user accounts/short term or long term depending on the objective

cover tracks-
remove log entries and audit records(apps/hosts and network devices)/ watch for missing timeframes in logs/ enable alerts when logs are modified

--common cloud computing security issues--
1. centralized data storage for many customers
2. cloud service public internet accessibility
3. lack of network and storage encryption
4. ease of self service
5. deletions and data remnants
6. on premises breaches for hybrid configurations
7. socail engineering and malware
8. single points of failure(no backups,single ISP)
9. lack of IT personnel training
10. lack of vulnerability and penetration testing
11. no centralized monitoring and alerting

---cloud identity---
1. user account
2. devices(PKI certificate)
3. software security principals
4. Multifactor authentication
5. Role based access control(RBAC)
